## 🔍 UX/UI Documentation

 **1. UX/UI Overview (markdown file):**
A `UX_UI.md` file summarizing all the UX and UI principles of the project — including design decisions, user flow, animations, accessibility focus, filtering, bilingual language support, and more.
- [UX/UI Principles](./UX_UI.md)

 **2. UX Walkthrough (markdown file):**
An additional file, `UX_FLOW.md`, describing the user journey — what happens on the homepage, how the user navigates to the islands, how hotels are selected, what interactions are encountered along the way, etc.
- [User Flow Walkthrough](./UX_FLOW.md)

# 🚀 Feature Overview

A fully responsive, UX-driven travel experience built with **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Framer Motion**, focusing on performance, accessibility, and engaging microinteractions.

---

## 🧭 Navigation & Structure

- **Multi-page SPA experience** using `slug`-based routing:
  - `/koh-phangan`, `/koh-samui`, `/koh-tao`, etc.
- **Sticky side navigation** with adaptive behavior:
  - On desktop: hover-based interaction.
  - On mobile: click/tap-based toggle.
- **Smooth scroll** and scroll-aware highlights to guide user flow.

---

## 🌐 Language & Direction Support

- **Bilingual UI**: Hebrew 🇮🇱 & English 🇬🇧.
- **Dynamic LTR/RTL direction** depending on selected language.
- Language toggle managed via **Context API** with persistent global state.

---

## 🔍 Content & Data

- **Live data from MongoDB**:
  - Pulled via `Mongoose` inside Next.js API routes.
  - Each island page loads its relevant content dynamically.
- **Hotel section**:
  - Region-based filter.
  - Flipping hotel cards with extra info and affiliate links.
  - Animated dropdown for sorting/filtering.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX & Animation

- **UX-focused layout**:
  - Clean typography and layout hierarchy.
  - Large tappable areas and mobile-first design principles.
- **Framer Motion animations**:
  - Section reveals, carousels, icon transitions, and hover effects.
  - Staggered entrance animations for better storytelling.
- **Microinteractions**:
  - Button feedback, carousel indicators, animated toggles.

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Responsive across:
  - Desktop 💻
  - Mobile 📲
- Elements reflow and resize based on screen size and orientation.

---

## ♿ Accessibility (A11y)

- **Semantic HTML** with structured headings and ARIA attributes (in progress).
- **Keyboard-accessible** interactive elements (focus states, skip links planned).
- **Reduced motion preferences** respected (if set by user).

---

## 🧠 State & Logic

- **Global state management** via `Context API`:
  - Language toggle
  - UI filters
- **URL-based state**:
  - Stateless filtering for hotels (stored in query params, not in Redux/Zustand).
  - Supports bookmarking and shareable filter states.

## ✨ UX & Interactive Design Highlights

- 🔁 **Scroll-based color transitions**:
  Navbar icons (Instagram, Facebook) change color dynamically based on scroll position, ensuring visibility across content sections.

- 🃏 **Hotel cards with flip animations**:
  - Clicking a hotel card reveals a back-side with booking link
  - Clicking outside flips it back smoothly

- 🎯 **Hotel filtering by region**:
  Filter buttons allow users to explore hotels by area (e.g. West Coast, North, East), improving discoverability.

- 🌐 **Language-aware layout**:
  LTR and RTL are fully supported, with mirrored animations and visual alignment for Hebrew/English.

- 🧭 **Mobile side nav toggle**:
  Responsive sidebar with click behavior for mobile users (tap to expand/collapse).

- 🖱️ **Hover interactions**:
  Interactive elements across the app respond visually to hover and tap, with smooth Framer Motion transitions.



---


## 🧠 Key Architectural Choices

- **No Redux or Zustand**: All state management is handled via URL params + Context API to minimize overhead and encourage stateless behavior.
- **Accessible-first**: All interactive elements are progressively enhanced and aim to support keyboard use (some work remains).
- **Design-led development**: UX wireframes and visual structure defined before code, ensuring consistency.
- **Component reusability**: Typography, cards, buttons, and layouts extracted and reused across pages.

---

## 🌍 Languages & Directionality

- Supports **Hebrew** and **English** with `dir="rtl"`/`ltr` rendering
- Text, layouts, and animations adapt to language choice
- Toggle available in top-right menu


---



## 🚀 Deployment

- Hosted live on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** with:
  - Image optimization
  - Dynamic routing
  - Incremental static regeneration (planned)
